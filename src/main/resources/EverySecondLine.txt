In Java 6, the process of reading from a file involves the following steps:
Creating a Buffer to store the read content.
Creating a Reader (stream) to read from the file.
Reading each line of the file separately.
Storing the results in a variable.
Handling potential exceptions that may occur from the Reader class and the Buffer.
Closing the stream in case of errors and ensuring the proper termination of the application.
